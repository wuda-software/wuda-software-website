        h2.card-title Physio Service System
        p.
          The healthcare sector is highly time-oriented, therefore it is important to have a robust and flexible scheduler.
          Together with our partner, we have developed a software application suitable for the healthcare sector, specifically physiotherapy.
          It can be used to manage multiple locations, appointments and therapists, as well as services.
          The physiotherapy software helps our partner to plan stress-free and patients to book their own appointments.
